<br>
A simple TEXAS HOLD'EM poker hand ranking service.</br>
Usage:</br>
The API expects the following URL build:</br>
/hand/board</br>
Card format has to follow the conventional poker hand formatting rules:</br>
Ace of spades : As</br>
King of hearts : Kh</br>
Ten of clubs : Tc</br>
Deuce of diamonds : 2d</br>
hand has to be exactly 2 cards long(4 characters)</br>
board can be 3 to 5 cards long(6 to 10 characters)</br>
example:</br>
'/AcKs/As2c3c4c8d'</br>
response is in json:</br>
{</br>
  "rank": "Pair",</br>
  "strength": 3363</br>
}</br>
strength is valued on a scale of 1 to 7462, where 1 is a Royal Flush</br>
and 7462 is unsuited 7-5-4-3-2, as there are only 7642 distinctly ranked hands in poker.</br>
